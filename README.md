# Banknote Classification Dataset:
The first step is to define and explore the dataset.

We will be working with the “Banknote” standard binary classification dataset.

The banknote dataset involves predicting whether a given banknote is authentic given a number of measures taken from a photograph.

The dataset contains 1,372 rows with 5 numeric variables. It is a classification problem with two classes (binary classification). the Data was found in Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aariyan101/bank-notes

# Below provides a list of the five variables in the dataset:
variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
kurtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).
entropy of image (continuous).
class (integer).
